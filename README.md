# PHPMailer
This is PHPMailer which is used to send email. 
I do a little repair to be used in localhost. 
Hope this helps you who are still having trouble running PHPMailer on localhost.

#How to Install
- Put this entire PHPMailer folder in your local web server directory. 
- The entire example already exists in the "example" folder
